# Exercises


## About

This project gathered small exercises that Iâ€™ve worked on

Each exercise would have a `objective.md` that you could view.


## Python Environment

The required packages could be installed by running `pipenv install` at project root directory.


## Testing

`tests` folder may exist in each exercise. You could use Pytest to test the written code.
